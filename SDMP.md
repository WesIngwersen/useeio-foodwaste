|  Dr. Daniel L. Young | Data Management: ORD OLEM team members will track publicly available existing data for Plastics Projects from articles, abstracts, books, book chapters, computer products, manuals, presentations, proceedings, reports, and scientific data sets. Findings to include attachments will be stored and retrievable in the Strategies for Characterization of Food Waste and Plastics Research database. '[Existing Data and Information Search Tool](https://plasticsprojects.epa.gov)' will be used to store all existing data research @ <https://plasticsprojects.epa.gov/.> For laboratory analysis, results will be entered into the Data Science Tool outlined in this project with final results stored in the '[Existing Data and Information Search Tool](https://plasticsprojects.epa.gov)'  |  USEPA |  <young.daniel@epa.gov> |
|  Mr. Jacob Specht | Data Management: Perform software IV&V on LRTD developed Open Source Software (OSS). Includes a systems engineering process employing rigorous methodologies for evaluating the correctness and quality of the software product throughout the SDLC. Software IV&V is adapted to the characteristics of each project as described in the approved QAPP and/or software planning document.  | Global Quality Corporation  | <jacob@gqc.com>  |

### Metadata

Metadata Methods/Template(s): Metadata to be included with numerical data records include: a) description of the time and locations for field data acquisition efforts, b) unique identifier labels assigned at time of collection and during laboratory analysis, c) notes that highlight unique aspects for a given sampling location or event that might qualify interpretation of numerical data, d) descriptors of sample types, matrix and geospatial coordinates, and e) units of measurement for numerical data. The metadata will be incorporated within Excel Workbooks that summarize data collected during each field sampling round in a standardized format developed for the project. The method of incorporating these metadata within the Trip Summary Dataset (Excel Workbook) will include: a) a separate worksheet dedicated to a narrative summary of descriptive metadata for each field sampling event, including filenames and repository for scanned electronic copies of field datasheets and notes, and b) worksheet headings, column headings, and cells within columns/rows organized via worksheet labels based on analysis type and/or data parameter type.
