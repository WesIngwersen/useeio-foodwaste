<h2>Food Waste “State of the Science” Reports.</h2>
<p>These products will build a scientific foundation for the EPA’s work to support the U.S. goal to halve food waste by 2030 by analyzing
the “State of the Science” for key issues related to US food waste.  The reports will cover: characterization of food waste; life cycle
environmental impacts of food waste and food waste reduction strategies and technologies; contaminants in food waste that may impact the
market for or safe land application of recycled food waste products; impact of biodegradable and compostable food packaging on food waste;
performance of compost for environmental services, such as remediation and runoff control; factors that may impede food waste reduction;
and elements of effective informational programs. The reports will also identify key research gaps.</p>

<h2>Jupyter Notebook.</h2>
<p> This project will use jupyter notebook to track the sampling and analysis results created during the course of these investigations.
JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: configure
and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. JupyterLab
is extensible and modular: write plugins that add new components and integrate with existing ones.</p>
