        <h2>Software IV&V</h2>
        <p>Software IV&V on LRTD developed Open Source Software (OSS). Includes a systems engineering process employing rigorous methodologies
        for evaluating the correctness and quality of the software product throughout the SDLC. Software IV&V is adapted to the characteristics
        of each project as described in the approved QAPP and/or software planning document.</p>

        <h2>Data Management</h2>
        <p>
            ORD OLEM team members will track publicly available existing data for Plastics Projects from articles, abstracts, books,
            book chapters, computer products, manuals, presentations, proceedings, reports, and scientific data sets. Findings to include
            attachments will be stored and retrievable in the Strategies for Characterization of Food Waste and Plastics Research database.
            'Existing Data and Information Search Tool' will be used to store all existing data research @ https://plasticsprojects.epa.gov/.
